As part of a cartographic design seminar during my fall semester at Middlebury College I developed an original print map of the prevalence and proximity of surface mining in and around Kanawha County, West Virginia. 

Surface mining, which includes mountain top removal mining, is an extremely destructive mining process that includes the removal of surface terrain to extract the minerals found below. Mountain top removal mining is predominantly practiced in the mountainous landscape of the Appalachian coal field within the eastern United States. This is a map that incorporates shaded relief with thematic representations of physical features in order to highlight the unique physical landscape of the region and the destructive mining practices that threaten it. For this map, I wanted to consider how we can use methods of terrain representation to consider spatial relationships between people and their environment. Therefore, this map is not just about the scale of mountain top removal mining in West Virginia but it is an attempt put it into perspective with the people that live there. This is a story with multiple characters: the unique mountainous terrain, the blotches of surface mines, inhabited valley lands and the streams that link them all.

**A little bit about the process**

This print map measures approximately 76.2 x 53.34 cm (30 x 21 in) and was developed using GIS and design programs including: QGIS, Google Earth Engine, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.

One of the hardest things that I had to grapple with was this idea of meeting expectations that I had put on myself when I started to think about this map. When it comes to the process of making something from an idea, things will not always go as planned. This project kept me on my toes and showed me how important it is to be flexible and open minded towards occasional failures. 

I anticipated working with terrain representation when I chose this topic and geographic case but did not expect it to be the most challenging hurdle that I would encounter. The intricacies of terrain representation were lost on me and I made many mistakes in the process of relearning the basics of the hillshade function in QGIS. I started off with a hillshade that appeared faded, flat, and abstract. Because the Kanawha River plays a central role in the local geography and this story of mountaintop removal, I needed to make it a central figure on the map. To do this I abandoned the typical north-south orientation and rotated my extent by about -135 degrees. This decision escalated my struggle to find the appropriate illumination angles. When trying to blend multiple layers of hillshade, I also struggled with finding the right balance between light and shadow. I brought up the Z factor, only did a one dimensional hillshade and decreased the value of the shadows in Photoshop. Additionally, I changed the darkest value from a gray to a medium brown hue to work with the other colors of the map. I don't consider this terrain representation perfect but it does its job in supporting the narrative that I wished to illustrate.
