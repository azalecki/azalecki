*To what extent does open source GIS help solve the problems of the reproducibility crisis for geography? How? Are there problems with reproducibility and replicability in geography that open source GIS cannot help solve?*

 Although Rey is referring specifically to software in this case, there is a lot of value of having the opportunity to peeking under the hood in other situations. When students learn how to use GIS (as a tool), they learn how to use it on a very fundamental level. Although they may be encouraged to explore and expand on this GIS knowledge, it can be hard to do so if this information is gatekept, even unconsciously. Here is an example.

This past J-Term I had the pleasure of  working with the Addison County Regional Planning Commission, where I spent some time learning and mapping the housing needs in Addison County, VT. Although my primary task was to consider different ways of mapping population densities in rural communities, I started reading about different ways to use GIS in order to assess suitable housing sites. The journal articles that I read about this topic used different methods and included a variety of sites and situations. Nevertheless, each seemed promising. I fantasized about reproducing one of these studies for my project but found it nearly impossible to do so. At the time I wasn't as well versed in GIS and the articles were not as transparent as I would have liked them to be. However, as a hands on learner, I would have appreciated the opportunity to atleast try to reproduce one of them because I believe there is value in doing so. Not only would it have helped me learn more about GIS, but the research would have been applicable to Addison County's housing crisis. From a student perspective, open source GIS can help solve some of these issues regarding transparency and honesty within the research process. If a certain method of assessing housing needs worked for one community, why wouldn’t we want to test it somewhere else?

Making GIS open source could facilitate student interest and involvement in geographic research. However, the accessibility of GIS is not the only thing that I think should change. Academic research, in general, can sometimes be difficult to understand for those who may be unfamiliar with haughty academic language, jargon, or specific technical methods. It is true that GIS demands specialized expertise but if we turn towards more reproducible research we might be able to make this tool more accessible. Additionally, academic research is deeply rooted this competitive need to produce significants research findings. Dr. Rachael Ainsworth discusses this toxic research culture and its effects both on the researcher and the quality of research. I believe we need to listen to Dr. Ainsworth and others like her who are calling for more oppenness and greater transparency. I think we in the GIS community only stand to gain from it.
