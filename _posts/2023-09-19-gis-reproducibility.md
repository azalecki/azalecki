To what extent does open source GIS help solve the problems of the reproducibility crisis for geography? How?
Are there problems with reproducibility and replicability in geography that open source GIS cannot help solve?

In "Show me the code: spatial analysis and open source", Sergio J. Rey writes, "Source code allows a student or researcher to peek the hood and examine the precise implementation of an spatial analytical method." Although Rey is referring specifically to software in this case, there is alot of value of having the opportunity to peeking under the hood in other situations. When students learn how to use GIS (as a tool) they learn how to use it on a very fundamental level. Although they may be encouraged to explore and expand on this GIS knowledge it can be hard to do so if this information is gatekept, even unconsciously. Here is an example. 

This part J-Term I was working with the local Regional Planning Commission where I spent some time learning about the housing needs in Addison County, VT. Although my primary task was to consider different ways of mapping population densities in rural communities I started reading about different ways to implement GIS in order to asses suitable housing site. The journal articles that I read about this topic all differed in method, site and situation but seemed promising. I fantasized about reproducing one of these studies for my project but found it nearly impossible to do so. At the time I wasn't as well versed in GIS and the articles were not as transparent as I would have liked them to be. However, as a hands on learner I would have cherished the opportunity to reproduce one of these studies. Not only would it have helped me learn more about GIS but the research would have had a real world application within Addison County's housing crisis. From a student perspective, open source GIS can help solves some of these issues with reproducibility. 

Making GIS open source could facilitate student interest and involvement in geographic research. However, the accessibility of GIS is not the only thing that I think should change. Academic research, in general, can sometimes be difficult to understand for those who may be unfamiliar with haughty academic language, jargon, or specific technical methods.
