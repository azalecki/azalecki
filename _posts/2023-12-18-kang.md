As a class, we worked on contributing to the reproduction of [“Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources: a case study of Illinois, USA” by Kang et al (2020)](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x). 

Here is a link to the reproduction.
