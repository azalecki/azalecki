For our second assignment in Open GIScience, as a class, we worked on contributing to the reproduction of [“Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa: An operationalized approach in Malawi” by Dylan W. Malcomb et al(2014)] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143622814000058?via%3Dihub).  

ok, emphasizes data classification with histograms and alternatives. Since the natural breaks method is likely very sensitive to changes in data, it might be a poor choice for comparing reproduction results, implying that this is a good idea to pursue.


Histogram to visualize data distribution (adaptive capacity)
Several alternative thematic maps with different classifications
Maps paired with tables summarizing the frequency of traditional authorities in each class
