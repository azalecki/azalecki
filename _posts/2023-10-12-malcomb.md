For our second assignment in Open GIScience, as a class, we worked on contributing to the reproduction of [“Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa: An operationalized approach in Malawi” by Dylan W. Malcomb et al(2014)] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143622814000058?via%3Dihub).  

I was interested in seeing how data classifications can potentially mislead the conclusions that are made in a study. In the original Malcomb (2014) study, Figure 4 is mapped using the Jenks Natural Breaks method. Having worked with visualizing data in QGIS before, I am aware that there are different methods for classifying nominal data. I was curious to see if the Natural Breaks method used in the study is the ideal method to use and if the classification method used has any effect on how adaptive capacity is visualized. 

To access the full report and the results of my data classification experimentation, 
You can read the full report [here](https://azalecki.github.io/RPr-Malcomb-2014) which can also be found in this [GitHub repository]( www.github.com/azalecki/RPr-Malcomb-2014/).
