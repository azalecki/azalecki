I can’t say that I consider my personal experience using GIS as purely “scientific.” Up to this point I have predominantly used GIS technologies as simply tools to analyze data and then make visualizations.. So in a way, my application of GIS has been limited by the kind of data that I put into it. GIS without data would be like a monitor without a computer. It’s as powerful as the data that it can draw upon so I never considered GIS as anything more than the data it needs to function. 

On that note, using software like QGIS or ArcGIS have made me feel somewhat limited in what I can accomplish with them. Running into bugs or not having a tool to run an certain type of analysis on multiple occasions has frustrated me. Understanding GIS as a "single technology" limits you to the elementary deskptop version of GIS. Which all things considered, isn't bad. These software programs make the GIS accessible and usable by those with no/limited coding backgrounds. For those who want to take Martin and Wing consider the role that corporations play in GIS development, circulation, and education.

> Software companies promote, develop, and distribute GIS as a non-variant and essentially unchanging object, open to only future perfection (Martin & Wing, 2007). 

With this considered, this attachment between the market and GIS is problematic for someone who wants to take GIS further. I have often felt limited by the tools available to me with conventional platforms like QGIS, ArcGIS, ArcMaps, etc. Without that kind of understanding I wonder what GIS would look like not bound by a singular program or version. On the one hand, teaching geographic concepts with a platform like QGIS makes sense because it’s relatively straightforward. On the other hand, I feel like all I can achieve with this approach is data entry and analysis. I think it would be great the think about other ways GIS would look like with new tools and applications.
That being said, just because I haven’t used it any other way doesn’t mean that I don’t think Geographic Information Systems can’t be science. GIS developers and engineers commonly ask questions about how geographic information systems work and how to better them. They will hypothesize and experiment for the sake of technological advancement. To me, that is science, and it would be cool to be one of those people. Other than that, there are particular scientific elements to GIS which if pulled out and examined further can be considered a science. For example, consider the creation and application of map projections. Trying to better how computers make those calculations or process geographic data can be considered a science. 

The last thing I will leave you with is: 
**You can't take the geographic out of GIS.**
