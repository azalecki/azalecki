I can’t say that I consider my personal experience using GIS as purely “scientific.” Up to this point, I have predominantly used GIS as as a tool to analyze data and make visualizations from that data. My application of GIS has been heavily limited by the kind of data that I have at my disposal. GIS without data would be like a monitor without a computer. It is only as powerful as the data that it can draw upon so I never considered GIS as anything more than a way to manipulate that data.

On that note, using software like QGIS or ArcGIS has made me feel limited in what I can accomplish with GIS. Often running into bugs, computing errors or not having a tool to run a certain type of analysis has made me frustrated with using Geographic Information Systems. Understanding GIS as a "single technology" limits you to the elementary desktop version of GIS. This is not necessarily a bad thing because these software programs have made GIS accessible and usable by those with no/limited coding backgrounds. Teaching geographic concepts with a platform like QGIS makes sense because it’s relatively straightforward and open-source. On the other hand, I feel like all I can achieve with this approach is data entry and analysis.

> Software companies promote, develop, and distribute GIS as a non-variant and essentially unchanging object, open to only future perfection (Martin & Wing, 2007).

Considering GIS as a "non-variant and essentially unchanging object", there is little room for experimentation and that can be problematic for someone who wants to take GIS further than its current marketable state. I have often felt limited by the tools available to me with conventional platforms like QGIS, ArcGIS, ArcMaps, etc. Without that kind of understanding, I wonder what GIS would look like if it were not bound by a singular program or version. I think it would be great the think about other ways GIS would look like with new tools and applications.

That being said, just because I haven’t used it any other way doesn’t mean that I don’t think Geographic Information Systems can’t be science. GIS developers and engineers commonly ask questions about how geographic information systems work and how to better them. They will hypothesize and experiment for the sake of technological advancement. To me, that is science, and it would be cool to be one of those people. Other than that, there are particular scientific elements to GIS which if pulled out and examined further can be considered a science. For example, consider the creation and application of map projections. Trying to better how computers make those calculations or process geographic data can be considered a science.
