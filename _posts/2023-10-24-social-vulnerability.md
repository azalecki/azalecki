I, personally, don’t have any experience dealing with social vulnerability models outside of this class and up until now had no idea what a social vulnerability analysis looks like. Models of social vulnerability attempt to calculate, map and predict peoples’ inability to deal with certain stressors or adverse impacts. Stressors commonly include natural disasters like hurricanes, disease outbreaks, heatwaves, etc. Last week when we reviewed the research design of the climate vulnerability mode in  Malcomb et al (2014), we were introduced to some of the major hurdles that come with modeling vulnerability. The study was difficult to reproduce because of data errors, uncertainty, and unclear research methods. 

In short, social vulnerability models seem to be difficult to but they shouldn’t be considering that they are increasingly used in disaster planning and hazard mitigation (Rufat et al, 2018). I don’t think we can be very confident in a model’s validity if the model cannot be accurately reproduced. Rufet et al writes that “Models can achieve validity both through empiricism and acceptance. The latter is currently the dominant mode.” If that is the case the reproduction of Social Vulnerability Model is even more critical for achieving validity. Perhaps through consistent reproduction we can not only continue to build upon these models and validate them but increase our understanding of them, as well. Lives and livelihoods depend on it.
