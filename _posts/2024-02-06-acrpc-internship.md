During my winter semester of 2022 I worked with the Addison County Regional Planning Commission. The ACRPC overssess planning and community development in the Addison region of Vermont. During the first week while my supervisor, Andrew, and I brainstormed a possible project for me I focused on drafting new ways to map population density of towns in the region. Understanding local populations metrics is critical for allocating time, energy and funding towards future development like housing projects. 
 
Mapping population density is usually done using administrative boundaries to make chloropleth maps.  If I was working on a different scale like a large metropolitan area or at the state level it would suffice. However, due to the rural nature of the Addison region, this mapping method is not as effective. Instead, mapping needs to be specifically location-based in order to avoid generalizations. 

One method that the ACRPC was already using was heat maps or Kernel density maps.

I experimented with a couple of different ways of mapping population density that included rectangular grids and hex grids.

Later that month I moved on to a different project where I researched the economic impacts of an alternative truck route constructed in Morrisville, VT. 

The study used publicly available retail sales tax, E911 address and traffic data to compare the alternative truck route to the original route. Additionally, using QGIS software we used E911 address points to determine if any retail flight had occurred from downtown Morristown. Traffic accident data was also mapped and analyzed to consider if the alternative route poses a notably higher safety hazard than the original route. We found that there was not a significant economic impact in Morrisville compared to the other towns in our study. There was almost no retail flight to the new area of the alternative route and the alternative route had to a great degree less traffic accidents than the original route. This study is meant to promote evidence-based decision making within planning discussions and help better inform citizens of the effects of bypasses on their communities. Highway bypasses are feared to have detrimental effects on small town economic development and this report includes a discussion of their implications as well as recommendations for future proposed highways. These include conducting pre-studies of traffic and regular economic surveys, regular input from locals and considering the historical and current land uses of the region of interest. 

I presented my findings at the Middlebury College Spring Student Symposium later that year.
