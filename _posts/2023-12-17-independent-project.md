For my final project in OpenGIScience, I reproduced a workflow that I created as part of my independent research work with Professor Peter Nelson during the Fall semester of 2023 which I created and implemented in QGIS. To improve the methods for this research and make it reproducible/replicable I decided to reproduce the QGIS workflow in R Studio. With the workflow I was planning on accomplishing two things: 91) locating libraries in Chicago, IL & delineating their service areas and (2) characterizing the neighborhoods that they serve using socioeconomic and demographic data. I was able to successfully locate the public libraries and generate a Voronoi diagram to delineate their service areas. Unfortunately, I came across many hurdles because of my very rudimentary knowledge of R. Bugs in my code for calculating the population-weighted aggregation stopped me from being able to complete the reproduction. Although this is a little frustrating, this project challenged me to problem solve at every step of the way and I feel more confident in my R coding abilities. It has also revealed to me the potential of GIS analysis in R. I will be continuing this reproduction in the coming months so stay tuned!
