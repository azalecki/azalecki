Hello! Witam! 

My name is Ola. I make maps. 
![about me image](/assets/images/aboutme_img.jpg)

I am a senior studying Geography and Spanish at Middlebury College. 
 
I was born and raised 900 miles west of Vermont in Chicago's northwest side to two Polish immigrant parents. Because of my upbringing I am passionate about migrant place-making, people oriented urban planning and hot dog stands. 
 
I find a lot of joy in creating, being challenged, and hands on projects where I can learn by doing.

When I'm not staring at the computer screen you can find me taking photos, reading crime fiction and pretending that I can bake.

Please feel free to contact me.
