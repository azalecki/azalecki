**Hello! Witam!**

My name is Ola Zalecki and I make maps. 

I am a senior studying Geography and Spanish at Middlebury College. 

I was born and raised 900 miles west of Vermont in Chicago's northwest side. Because of my upbringing I am passionate about understanding migrant place-making, promoting people oriented urban planning, and hot dog stands. 
 
I find a lot of joy in creating and seek out opportunities that challenge me as learner. I naturally gravitate towards hands-on projects where I am given the space to think creatively and critically. 

When I'm not staring at my computer screen you can find me baking, reading crime fiction and pretending that I'm a photographer.
